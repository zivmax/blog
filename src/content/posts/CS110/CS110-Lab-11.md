# Lab 11

[Computer Architecture I](https://toast-lab.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/courses/CS110@ShanghaiTech/Spring-2024/index.html) @ [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/)  
Download the starter code [here](https://toast-lab.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/courses/CS110@ShanghaiTech/Spring-2024/labs/Lab11/lab11.tar)

## Introduction to SIMD

[SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) makes a program faster by executing the same instruction on multiple data at the same time. In this lab, we will use [Intel Intrinsics](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html) to implement simple programs.

## Part 1: Vector addition

In this part, you will implement a vector addition program using SIMD. Please "translate" naive_add() to simd_add().  
You may use the following intrinsics, search in the [Intel Intrinsics Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html):

- _mm_loadu_si128
- _mm_storeu_si128
- _mm_add_epi32

Try to tell the difference of the following "load" intrisics:

- _mm_load_si128
- _mm_loadu_si128
- _mm_load_pd
- _mm_load1_pd

## Part 2: Matrix multiplication

In this part, you will implement a matrix multiplication program using SIMD. Please "translate" naive_matmul() to simd_matmul().  
You may use the following intrinsics:

- _mm_setzero_ps
- _mm_set1_ps
- _mm_loadu_ps
- _mm_add_ps
- _mm_mul_ps
- _mm_storeu_ps

Explain why this makes the program faster.

## Part 3: Loop unrolling

Read Wikipedia and try to understand the concept of loop unrolling:

- [Loop unrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling)

Implement loop_unroll_matmul() and loop_unroll_simd_matmul(), explain the performance boost they brought.

## Part 4: Compiler optimization

Run `make test`, explain why `-O3` makes the program much faster.  
For checkup: Put this piece of code into [godbolt.org](https://godbolt.org/) , compile them with a risc-v compiler, and tell the difference between `-O0` and `-O3`.  

int a = 0;

void modify(int j) {
    a += j;
}


int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        a += 1;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        a += i;
    }

    return a;
}
