# CS100 Homework 1 (Spring 2023)

Deadline: 2023-02-26 (Sun) 23:59:59

Late submission will open for 24 hours after the deadline, with 50% point deduction.

If you get full marks in this assignment by no more than 20 submission attempts, you can earn
special OJ displays and a "1-case protection" that can be used in further assignments to cancel
one testcase failure. See Piazza or OJ dashboard for more information.

## Problem 1: Find Bugs!

## Description

Your friend has just started learning programming, and has spent hours on a textbook practice
problem. He/She asks you for help by treating you to a KFC Crazy Thursday meal. You agree, and
he/she sends you a ` .txt` file:

```c
#include <sudo.h>

void main（）
{
    // Calculate the average score of all students in a class.

    int num;
    int sum;

    printf('How many students are there?/n')
    scanf('d%', num)
    printf("What are their scores?/n")

    // We programmers count from zero!
    for (int i = 0, i <= num, i++);
    {
        int sum, score;
        scanf("d%", score);
        sum += score;
    }

    double average = sum / num;
    if (average = 60)
        printf('Good!/n');
    if (average > 60)
        printf('Excellent!/n');
    else
        printf(“Bad!/n”);

    printf("Average score is &.2f./n", average);

    return 0;
}

```

For the sake of Crazy Thursday, you now have the responsibility to debug your friend's code
(Don't do so in ShanghaiTech!). You may first fix compile errors so that the code runs, and then
figure out why it (possibly) does not produce correct results.

### Input format

The first line contains a number , representing the number of students in a class.

The following lines each contain , score of a student.


- For 100% cases, $0 < n \leqslant  50$, and $0 < s_i \leqslant 100$.

### Output format

Four sentences, specified as in `printf` statements in the code.

In the last sentence, format the average score to **2 decimal digits**.

### Example

Input:
```
2
70
81
```

Output:

```
How many students are there?
What are their scores?
Excellent!
Average score is 75.50.
```

## Problem 2: Equation of A Line

### Description

Input two points' coordinates $(x,\ y)$ , where $x$ and $y$ are two integers. You need to calculate the
equation of the line going through these two points in the form of $y = kx + b$, or $x = c$ (when
the slope `k` doesn't exist).

### Input format

Two lines, each containing a coordinate in the form `(x, y)` , where `x` and `y` are integers.

- For 100% cases, $|x| < 1000$, and $|y| < 1000$.

### Output format

A line in the form of `y = kx [+/-] b` , or `x = c` .


- `k` , `b` and `c` should all be of type `double` . When printed, format them to **2 decimal digits**.
If `b < 0` , the minus sign - should take place of the `+` , turning the result into `y = kx - b` .

- You do not need to simplify the cases $b= 0$, $k=0$, and $k = \pm 1$ . Just leave the number
there, like y = 1.00x + 0.00.

Pay attention to spaces before and after `'='` and `'+'/'-'` . It's safest to directly copy-paste the
above equations into your code.

### Example

Input:
```
(2, -1)
(4, -3)
```

Output:
```
y = -1.00x + 1
```

Input:
```
(-2, 3)
(4, -6)
```

Output:
```
y = -1.50x + 0
```

Input:
```
(-10, -3)
(2, -3)
```

Output:
```
y = 0.00x - 3
```

Input:
```
(-2, 0)
(-2, 1)
```

Output:

```
x = -2
```

## Problem 3: Spell It Out


### Description

"How I wish that numbers could be gone!", cursed you after a terrible math exam. That exact
night, you had a bad dream where all numbers have disappeared! No one understands 1, 2, 3,
and you had to spell them out in English like one, two, three!

Luckily you had a computer to do all this, and a piece of guide to follow:



- Use a hyphen (`'-'`) to connect a word ending in -ty to another word. (22 -> twenty-two, 48000 -> forty-eight thousand)

- There is **NO** "-s" (plural) for words "hundred" and "thousand". Also, 100 and 1000 are spelled "one hundred" and "one thousand".

- To use or to not use an "and" after "hundred" is both OK. However, inserting an "and" makes the spelling easier to read, so let's <u>put an "and" after "hundred" or "thousand" when they are followed by a part less than 100</u>. (101 -> one hundred **and** one, 2023 -> two thousand **and** twenty-three, 114500 -> one hundred **and** fourteen thousand five hundred)

- **NO** comma (`','`) after the world "thousand", although it sounds more natural to stop there when reading numbers out.

- Pay attention to spellings, especially for "fourteen", "forty", "nineteen", and "ninety"! You don't want to spend hours debugging to find out nothing but a typo!

### Input description

The input is a number.

- For 20% cases, $0 \leqslant x \leqslant 999$ .
- For 20% cases, `x % 1000 == 0` .
- For 100% cases, $0 \leqslant x \leqslant 999999$ .

### Output description

You should output the English spelling of number x in one line. It's OK whether you end the line
with a `'\n'` or not.

### Hints


- This problem does NOT involve strings (something we haven't learned)! Try to <u>separate the output into different parts</u>, and print each one with a `printf`! Keep in mind that `printf` does not necessarily end with a `'\n'` .

- Some work might need to be performed multiple times (like translating 1-9 into "one" through "nine"). Why not write them into functions to make things easy and avoid bugs?

### Sample input/outputs

| Input  | Output                                         |
| :----- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | zero                                           |
| 44     | forty-four                                     |
| 1590   | one thousand five hundred and ninety           |
| 114500 | one hundred and fourteen thousand five hundred |
