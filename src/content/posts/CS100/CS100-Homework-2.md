## Problem 2: Quadratic Equation

Solving a linear equation is too hard, so we will solve a quadratic equation. A quadratic equation is of the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$, where $a,b,c$ are constant real numbers and the unknown $x\in\mathbb R$.

Given the coefficients $a,b$ and $c$, your task is to solve the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$.

To make the problem easier, $a$ **may be zero**. To make the problem harder, it is guaranteed that $a,b,c\in\mathbb Z$.

Solve the equation and output the solution(s).

- If the equation is a quadratic one, your output should be of one of the following forms (where `???` is replaced with the exact solution):
  - `x1 = x2 = ???`
  - `x1 = ???, x2 = ???` where $x_1<x_2$
  - `No solution.`
- Otherwise, your output should be of one of the following forms (where `???` is replaced with the exact solution):
  - `x = ???`
  - `No solution.`
  - `x\in\mathbb{R}`, indicating $x\in\mathbb R$ in $\LaTeX$

All the output numbers should be rounded to **three decimal places**.

It is guaranteed that $|a|,|b|,|c|\leqslant 100$.

### Samples

**Sample 1**

#### Input

```
1 2 1
```

#### Output

```
x1 = x2 = -1.000
```

**Sample 2**

#### Input

```
1 0 1
```

#### Output

```
No solution.
```

**Sample 3**

#### Input

```
0 0 0
```

#### Output

```
x\in\mathbb{R}
```

**Sample 4**

#### Input

```
1 3 2
```

#### Output

```
x1 = -2.000, x2 = -1.000
```

## Problem 3: Hexadecimal Calculator

You are given two integers $a$ and $b$ in hexadecimal representation. Your task is to perform addition $a+b$ or subtraction $a-b$ in hexadecimal using the vertical method (竖式).

### Input

Three lines in total.

The first line contains a character that is either `'+'` or `'-'`, which indicates the operation you need to perform.

The next two lines are the integers $a$ and $b$ respectively, in hexadecimal representation.

### Output

Show how you do the vertical addition/subtraction. Your output should be of one of the following forms:

```
   xxxxxxxx
  p    yyyy
  ---------
     zzzzzz
```


```
         xx
  pyyyyyyyy
  ---------
   zzzzzzzz
```

  where the `x`'s and `y`'s represent the input numbers $a$ and $b$, and `p` is either `+` or `-` depending on the input.

### Samples

**Sample 1**

#### Input

```
+
1ab
2c
```

#### Output

```
 1ab
+ 2c
----
 1d7
```

**Sample 2**

#### Input

```
-
abc
a12
```

#### Output

```
 abc
-a12
----
  aa
```

### Notes

Let $L(x)$ be the length of the hexadecimal representation (i.e. the number of digits required) of $x$. Let $r$ be the result (either $a+b$ or $a-b$). It is guaranteed that

- $a,b,r\geqslant 0$.
- $L(a),L(b)\leqslant 50$.
- $L(r)\leqslant\max\{L(a),L(b)\}$.
- The letters in the hexadecimal representations are all in lower-case.

## Problem 4: Bit Operation

### Background (You can skip this entire section)

In the year 1979, a young astronomer named Ye Wenjie is working on a project that aims to send radio signals to outer space in search of extraterrestrial intelligence. Ye Wenjie is a survivor of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, a period of political turmoil and violence that killed her father and traumatized her. She has lost faith in humanity and hopes to find a better civilization in the stars.

Ye Wenjie’s project is supported by a secret military base called Red Coast. The base has a powerful antenna that can transmit and receive signals from distant galaxies. Ye Wenjie uses the antenna to send messages to various star systems, hoping to get a response. She also receives messages from other human radio stations around the world.

One day, she receives a message from an unknown source that gives her a coding problem as a way of testing her intelligence and curiosity. The problem is in the discription.

Ye Wenjie solves the problem using her knowledge of binary arithmetic and sends her code back to the source. She thinks that by doing so she can establish contact with an alien civilization and learn more about their culture and technology. She doesn’t know that by doing so she has also invited a hostile invasion from a ruthless enemy…

### Description

In this problem, your task is to split a number into two parts by binary digits and reassemble them to form a new number.

You will recieve an unsigned integer $x$ whose binary representation consists of $n$ digits (You need to find $n$ on yourself!), and a non-negative integer $m$. First, you need to split out the rightmost $m+1$ digits to form an integer $p$, and the rest digits form an integer $q$. Then, place $p$ on the left of $q$ (in binary representation) to obtain a new number.

Formally, write $x$ as

$$x=(x_{n-1}\dots x_1x_0)_{\text{two}}$$

where $x_i\in\{0,1\}$ and $x_{n-1}=1$. Then

$$p=(x_{m}\dots x_1x_0)_{\text{two}},\quad\text{and}\quad q=(x_{n-1}\dots x_{m+1})_{\text{two}}.$$

The reassembled integer should be

$$y=(x_{m}\dots x_1x_0x_{n-1}\dots x_{m+1})_{\text{two}}.$$

Then, you need to calculate the "lowbit" of $y$. The "lowbit" of an integer $k=(k_{n-1}\dots k_1k_0)_{\text{two}}$ is the smallest index $t$ such that $k_t=1$.

For example, if $x=54=(110110)_{\text{two}}$ and $m=1$, $p$ should be $(10)_{\text{two}}$ and $q$ is $(1101)_{\text{two}}$ in binary representation. So the reassembled integer is $y=(101101)_{\text{two}}=45$. The "lowbit" of $y$ is $0$ since the rightmost bit of $y$ is $1$.

### Input

One line containing two integers $x$ and $m$, separated by a space.

### Output

Two integers $y$ and $b$ on the same line, separated by a space. $y$ is the reassembled integer (in decimal representation) and $b$ is the lowbit of $y$.

### Samples

**Sample 1**

#### Input

```
114514 4
```

#### Output

```
77306 1
```

**Sample 2**

#### Input

```
2333333 17
```

#### Output

```
3778904 3
```

### Notes

$0 < x \leqslant 2^{63}-1$

$0 \leqslant m\leqslant 61$

It is guaranteed that $m\leqslant n-2$.

## Problem 5: No-Horse Sudoku

"No-horse sudoku", as interesting as its name sounds (especially in Chinese), is a kind of irregular sudoku with new rules. In this problem, your goal is to judge whether a given board of "no-horse sudoku" is valid. 

### Rules
![sudoku-board](https://s2.loli.net/2023/03/09/3HOgFq6hZLB854Y.png)

A regular sudoku has 3 rules:

- Every number should appear exactly once in a column.
- Every number should appear exactly once in a row.
- Every number should appear exactly once in a "palace" (any of the nine equally divided $3\times3$ regions).

For "no-horse sudoku", we have an additional rule related to a concept "horse step".

Similar to the rules of horses in chess, we define that <u>two grids share a "horse step" if they lie diagonally in a $2 \times 3$ or $3 \times 2$ rectangle</u> (The pair (E5, C4), for example).

Now here comes the additional rule:

- Any two grids sharing a "horse step" should not be filled in with the same number.

### Your Task

Write a program that reads in an entire sudoku board and judges whether the board is valid under the "no-horse sudoku" rules. The whole board is valid if and only if all the numbers in the grids are valid.

It is recommended that you implement such a function (or anything similar to this), which can help you make your code clear and readable.

```c
bool checkOneNumber(int (*board)[9], int row, int col);
```

- Brief: Judges whether the number in the grid `board[row][col]` is valid under the "no-horse sudoku" rules.
- Parameters:
  - `board`: a $9\times 9$ array representing the sudoku board
  - `row`: the row index of the target grid
  - `col`: the column index of the target grid
- Return value: `true` if the number in that grid is valid, `false` otherwise.

### Input:

$9$ lines, each line containing $9$ numbers separated by space, representing a row of the sudoku board. The $i$-th line of the input represents the $i$-th row (top to bottom) in the sudoku board.

### Output:

`1` or `0`. Output `1` if the board is valid, and `0` otherwise.

### Important Note

We will check whether you earned your score for this problem in a proper way. Some tricks may get you a high score on OJ, but it will be in vain in the end.

### Samples

Some examples of valid boards:

```
8 6 4 3 1 5 2 9 7
5 1 7 9 6 2 3 8 4
3 2 9 7 8 4 1 5 6
4 3 6 8 7 1 9 2 5
1 7 5 2 3 9 6 4 8
9 8 2 5 4 6 7 1 3
6 9 1 4 5 7 8 3 2
7 5 3 1 2 8 4 6 9
2 4 8 6 9 3 5 7 1
```

```
1 4 3 7 8 9 6 2 5
2 5 9 3 4 6 1 8 7
6 7 8 2 5 1 3 9 4
9 6 4 8 7 5 2 3 1
5 3 1 9 6 2 4 7 8
8 2 7 1 3 4 9 5 6
4 9 2 5 1 7 8 6 3
3 1 5 6 9 8 7 4 2
7 8 6 4 2 3 5 1 9 
```

Some examples of boards that are valid under normal rules but invalid with the "no-horse" rule:

```
6 8 4 5 1 7 3 9 2
7 2 9 3 4 8 5 6 1
1 3 5 2 6 9 4 8 7
5 1 6 8 3 2 9 7 4
8 9 7 1 5 4 2 3 6
2 4 3 9 7 6 8 1 5
3 7 1 4 9 5 6 2 8
9 5 2 6 8 1 7 4 3
4 6 8 7 2 3 1 5 9
```

```
5 3 2 8 7 1 4 6 9 
4 9 6 2 5 3 1 8 7 
8 7 1 9 4 6 5 2 3 
3 5 7 1 6 4 8 9 2 
9 6 4 3 8 2 7 5 1 
1 2 8 5 9 7 6 3 4 
7 8 5 4 2 9 3 1 6 
6 1 9 7 3 5 2 4 8 
2 4 3 6 1 8 9 7 5
```
